# Implementing architecture patterns by refactoring a python app
In this project I want to show a ways to refactor a python app. I will write about common use architectural patterns like DDD, CQSR and Clean Architecture.
Switch a branch to read about refactoring step you interested in.

## Buisness Requirements
In my company we have some projects in private git repositories. Each project is a set of folders, xml files and may contain other types of files.
The main task is to modify xml files according to some business rules.

## Step 2. Success
I had a success and first version of my app was done.
On this brunch you will see it.

## Step 3. Ball of mud
